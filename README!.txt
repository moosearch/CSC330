MIDTERMS
=========

We never done ANY of the midterms in the style that is presented in the old midterms; instead:

1) We were put in groups of 8-10
2) At 5pm of the day of the midterm, 4 subtopics about a particular topic was posted and we had until midnight to research it, compile a 10 - 15 page paper, and a powerpoint slide for it to present our findings the next day.

They were useless.

The midterm material was posted for every group and is available in "midterms" folder.

The final exam was not a group project but rather represented what you would see in the past final exams.
