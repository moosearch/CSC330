      Course Overview  
    </td>
    <td class="course_desc_detail" width="80%">
      An introduction to the fundamental concepts in imperative, 
functional, logic and concurrent programming languages. A language for 
programming is defined by its syntax and semantics. Syntax defines how a
 syntactically correct program is constructed; semantics defines how the
 computation is carried out by such a program. Turing machines, Lambda 
Calculus and Logical Deduction are three distinctly different models of 
computation. With concurrency, a common model of computation is that of a
 (possibly infinite state) transition system, where communication and 
synchronization are paramount. This course is about the principles 
underlying the design of these four classes of programming languages, 
and the idioms in using these languages for solving distinct classes of 
programming problems.

There will be three in-class 1-hour tests during the term, one every 
three weeks. The exact day of the week for the test is random. These 
tests form an integral part of your evaluation. The test materials will

<b><i>Coursework Mark Appeals:</i></b> All marks must be appealed <b>within 7 days</b> of the mark being posted.

<b><i>Attendance:</i></b> We expect students attend all lectures and

<b><i>Electronic devices in labs and lectures:</i></b> No unauthorized <i>audio</i> or <i>video</i> recording of lectures is permitted.

<b><i>Electronic devices in midterms and exams: </i></b> Calculators are
 only permitted for examinations and tests if explicitly authorized and 
the type of calculator permitted may be restricted. No other electronic 
devices (e.g. cell phones, pagers, PDA, etc.) may be used during 
examinations or tests <i>unless explicitly authorized</i>.
<br>
<b><i>Plagiarism:</i></b> Submitted work may be checked using plagiarism
 detection software. Cheating, plagiarism and other forms of academic 
fraud are taken very seriously by both the University and the 
Department. You should consult <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html">http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html</a>
for the UVic policy on academic integrity. Note that the university 
policy includes the statement that "A largely or fully plagiarized 
assignment should result in a grade of F for the course".

curriculum and to meet the syllabus requirements.  Reasonable and 
appropriate accommodation will be made available to students with 
documented disabilities (physical, mental, learning) in order to give 
them the opportunity to successfully meet the essential requirements of

knowledge and skills in a different way.  It is not necessary for you to
 reveal your disability and/or confidential medical information to the 
course instructor.  If you believe that you may require accommodation, 
the course instructor can provide you with information about 
confidential resources on campus that can assist you in arranging for 
appropriate accommodation.  Alternatively, you may want to contact the 
Resource Centre for Students with a Disability located in the Campus
